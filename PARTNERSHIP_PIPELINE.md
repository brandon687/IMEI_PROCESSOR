### ROI Calculation Example

**Current State (via GSM Fusion):**
- Volume: 10,000 checks/month
- Average cost: $0.08/check
- Monthly cost: $800
- Annual cost: $9,600

**Target State (Direct Partnerships):**
- Volume: 10,000 checks/month
- Average cost: $0.03/check (70% reduction)
- Monthly cost: $300
- Annual cost: $3,600

**Savings:** $6,000/year at 10,000 checks/month

**Break-even:** With $20,000 investment, break-even at ~33 months at current volume
**Accelerated Break-even:** At 50,000 checks/month, break-even in ~7 months

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Partnership Rejection
- **Mitigation:** Pursue multiple providers simultaneously (5-10 contacts in parallel)
- **Backup:** Maintain GSM Fusion as fallback provider

### Risk 2: High Minimum Volume Requirements
- **Mitigation:** Start with no-minimum providers (IMEI.org, ImeiCheck.net)
- **Strategy:** Aggregate volume across multiple services to meet minimums

### Risk 3: API Quality Issues
- **Mitigation:** Test thoroughly before migrating production traffic
- **Strategy:** Parallel run new APIs alongside existing for validation period

### Risk 4: Long Approval Timelines (Apple GSX, GSMA)
- **Mitigation:** Start applications early (Months 4-6)
- **Strategy:** Pursue shorter-term partnerships while waiting for long-term approvals

### Risk 5: Cost Overruns
- **Mitigation:** Set strict budget caps per provider
- **Strategy:** Start with free tiers and prove ROI before upgrading
