# US Mobile Carrier API Partnership Research
## Device Unlock & IMEI Services

**Research Date:** November 13, 2025
**Focus:** API partnerships for device unlock and IMEI verification services with major US carriers

---

## Executive Summary

This research document provides comprehensive information about establishing API partnerships with the four major US mobile carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and US Cellular) for device unlock and IMEI services.

**Key Findings:**
- Major carriers do NOT currently offer dedicated device unlock APIs to third parties
- Current API offerings focus on network capabilities (5G, SIM Swap, Number Verification, QoS)
- All three major carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon) are collaborating through **Aduna** platform for standardized network APIs
- Device unlock services remain consumer-facing portals rather than B2B API products
- Third-party IMEI verification services exist but operate independently of direct carrier partnerships
- GSMA IMEI Database access is highly restricted and primarily available to mobile network operators

## 8. Key Findings & Recommendations

### Critical Insights

#### 1. No Direct Carrier Unlock APIs
- None of the four major US carriers offer B2B APIs specifically for device unlocking
- Device unlock remains a consumer-facing service through web portals and customer service
- This represents a significant market gap

#### 2. Current API Focus
All carriers are focused on:
- Network performance and quality (5G, latency, bandwidth)
- Security (SIM Swap detection, fraud prevention, anomaly detection)
- Authentication (Number Verification, device status)
- IoT and M2M connectivity
- Communication services (SMS, voice, video)

#### 3. Unified API Initiative (Aduna)
- Represents major shift toward standardized APIs
- AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon working together for first time
- Focus on Number Verification and SIM Swap (security/authentication)
- Not focused on device unlocking services

#### 4. Third-Party Market
- Robust ecosystem of independent IMEI/unlock service providers
- These operate WITHOUT direct carrier API partnerships
- Services likely use combination of:
  - Web scraping carrier portals
  - Direct relationships with device manufacturers
  - GSMA database queries (where authorized)
  - Proprietary databases built over time

### Potential Partnership Strategies

#### Strategy A: Network API Partnership
**Target:** Aduna platform or individual carrier developer programs
**Approach:**
1. Register for developer accounts on all three platforms (DevEdge, AT&T Developer, Verizon APIs)
2. Explore SIM Swap and Number Verification APIs through Aduna
3. Build complementary services around device authentication/verification
4. Position for future unlock API offerings if they emerge

**Pros:**
- Access to official carrier APIs
- Part of industry-standard platform
- Strong foundation for future expansion

**Cons:**
- Does not directly address unlock/IMEI core business
- Longer path to revenue

#### Strategy B: Reseller/Partner Program Entry
**Target:** AT&T Partner Exchange, T-Mobile Business Partner, Verizon Partner Network
**Approach:**
1. Apply as solution provider/reseller with existing business model
2. Build relationships with carrier business development teams
3. Propose device unlock API as value-added service for wholesale partners
4. Leverage partner status to influence API roadmap

**Pros:**
- Direct relationships with carrier leadership
- Inside track for new service development
- Revenue opportunities from existing partner benefits

**Cons:**
- Requires substantial business credentials
- May require capital investment
- No guarantee of unlock API development

#### Strategy C: Third-Party Aggregation
**Target:** Existing IMEI/unlock API providers
**Approach:**
1. Partner with established providers (IMEI.org, UnlockBase, IMEIcheck.net)
2. Build value-added layer on top of their services
3. Focus on user experience, integration, and reliability
4. Pursue wholesale pricing agreements

**Pros:**
- Immediate market entry
- Proven technology stack
- Lower barrier to entry

**Cons:**

#### Strategy D: GSMA Database Access (Long-term)
**Target:** GSMA limited access program
**Approach:**
1. Build business as qualified industry affiliate (device insurance, repair, etc.)
2. Apply for limited IMEI database access
3. Develop direct relationships with carriers as authorized data user
4. Expand services based on official data access

**Pros:**
- Authoritative data source
- Potential for carrier relationships
- Differentiation from competitors

**Cons:**
- High barriers to entry
- Annual fees
- Strict regulations and compliance
- May not include unlock functionality

## 10. Conclusion

The US carrier market for device unlock and IMEI verification APIs presents both challenges and opportunities:

**Challenges:**
- No carriers currently offer dedicated unlock APIs to third parties
- High barriers to carrier partnership programs
- GSMA database access is highly restricted
- Existing third-party market is competitive

**Opportunities:**
- Market gap exists for official carrier unlock APIs
- New Aduna platform shows carriers willing to collaborate on APIs
- Growing API focus across all carriers creates partnership openings
- Third-party aggregation model is viable near-term strategy

**Bottom Line:**
Direct carrier partnerships for device unlock APIs will require significant relationship building, business credibility, and likely a phased approach starting with their existing API programs (developer accounts, business partnerships) while simultaneously operating through third-party providers to generate revenue and demonstrate market need.

The most promising path appears to be a hybrid approach: establish official developer relationships with all carriers, build initial services on third-party APIs, and use market success to advocate for direct unlock API access from carriers.
